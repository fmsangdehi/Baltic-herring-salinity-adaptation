# Genomic basis of early-life adaptation of Baltic herring to low-salinity environment

## About the Project
This repository is related to a collaborative research project investigating the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of herring to the brackish Baltic Sea environment.

Our study focuses on how marine fish adapt to low-salinity conditions through genetic changes in genes critical for reproduction and early development, including sperm-, egg-, and embryo-associated proteins.

## Overview of key findings
Atlantic herring has successfully colonized the Baltic Sea (where salinity reaches as low as ~3‰) from the North Atlantic (where salinity is ~35‰) within the last 8,000 years. Our study identifies four key gene families under strong natural selection that enable reproduction in brackish water:

- **LRRC8C2** – a sperm-specific volume-regulated anion channel that helps prevent sperm swelling at low salinity  
- **ZPBA** – a major egg envelope protein with sequence changes in Baltic populations  
- **FTG1–3** – fish transglutaminase genes involved in producing a denser egg envelope resistant to swelling  
- **HE1C** – hatching enzyme genes showing massive copy number expansion, enabling larvae to digest the reinforced egg envelope  

Notably, three of these four gene families (ZPBA, FTG1-3, and HE1C) show evidence of adaptive introgression from Pacific herring populations.
